/**
 * KUBO Anywhere — single source of truth for the multi-platform execution and
 * billing model.
 *
 * Two execution models exist and they are billed differently:
 *  - `cloud`  → code runs in an ephemeral KUBO Cloud container (iOS/iPadOS,
 *               Android). Billed per active container minute.
 *  - `local`  → code runs on the user's own hardware through the KUBO Local
 *               Agent daemon (Windows, macOS, Linux). No infrastructure cost
 *               for us, so it is billed per AI action, exactly like Vibe Code.
